SETSmm Iceberg Order Exercise
The object of this exercise is to implement a simulator for SETSmm Iceberg order
functionality in Java as specified in the document “SETSmm and Iceberg Orders
Service & Technical Description”.
Requirements:
• The simulator will deal with only a single order book for each run.
• It will receive orders from stdin in a simplified ASCII format specified later
in this document, which will either be limit or iceberg orders (ignore the
message specifications in the technical document)
• On receipt of an order from stdin, the solution should apply that order to the
book, possibly generating trade messages to stdout when there is matching to
be done, and then display the current book in formats specified later
• Error handling can be kept to a minimum and error conditions such as badly
formatted input will not be evaluated. However, any error messages you may
wish to provide should be directed to stderr.
Input Format
For simplicity, this simulation only deals with order entry of either limit or iceberg
orders. Orders cannot be modified or cancelled once entered into the book. Hence, the
only messages to be received from stdin are order entry messages.
Input is received from stdin in the form of individual lines delimited by newlines. A
line may consist entirely of whitespace characters (empty); begin with whitespace
followed by the # character and subsequently any other characters (comment); in
comma-separated ASCII format (data). Lines formatted as empty or comment shall be
ignored. You may assume that lines formatted as data will always be correctly
formatted, with no deviation from the specified types and no overflow (for simplicity,
all prices are in whole pence, no fractions are allowed). Data lines may be one of:
Insert Limit Order
This message is contained within a single line, with comma-separated values:
Field Index Type Description
0 char ‘B’ for a buy order, ‘S’ for a sell order
1 int unique order identifier
2 short price in pence (> 0)
3 int quantity of order (> 0)
Example:
B,100322,5103,7500
Description:
Limit order ID 100322: Buy 7,500 at 5,103p.
Insert Iceberg Order
This message is practically identical to an insert limit order message, except that it
contains one extra field specifying the peak size. It is again contained within a single
line, with comma-separated values. Unlike the associated technical document, for the
purposes of this simulation iceberg orders only have a single order identifier (no
hidden identifier) that will be used in trade messages.
Field Index Type Description
0 char ‘B’ for a buy order, ‘S’ for a sell order
1 int unique order identifier (> 0)
2 short price in pence (> 0)
3 int quantity of order (> 0)
4 int peak size (> 0)
Example:
S,100345,5103,100000,10000
Description:
Iceberg order ID 100345: Sell 100,000 at 5103p, with a peak size of 10,000.
You may assume that the peak size is never greater than the total quantity.
Output Format
All non-error output should be directed to stdout. For each order insert message, the
solution should apply the order to the current book and generate any matched trades in
order of their first matches, and then output the current book.
Trade Format
A trade message should be sent to stdout for each matched trade. Note that in the
technical specification it states that only a single trade message will be sent for each
iceberg order, even if the match occurs on more than one peak (e.g. a match size of
16,000 on an iceberg order with a peak size of 10,000 should trade once for a quantity
of 16,000, not one for 10,000 and another for 6,000).
The trade message should be contained within a single line, with nothing else present
on the same line, and be in comma-separated format with the following fields.
Field Index Type Description
0 int buy order ID matched
1 int sell order ID matched
2 short price in pence
3 int quantity
Example:
100322,100345,5103,7500
Book format
Following the receipt of an order message, and after resolving any matches in the
book and outputting any generated trade messages, the solution should display the
current full order book in the following example format:
• Id columns width (excluding formatting marks) = 10
• Volume columns width (excluding formatting marks) = 13
• Price columns width (excluding formatting marks) = 7
• Total width including 7 formatting marks = 67
• All headers left-justified with single space between formatting mark and start
of text
• All data fields right-justified with no space between data and formatting mark
• Order IDs should be formatted as plain numbers (i.e. 103749 not 103,749), but
volumes and prices should be formatted with commas (i.e. 100,000 not
100000).
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| BUY | SELL |
| Id | Volume | Price | Price | Volume | Id |
+----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------------+----------+
|1234567890|1,234,567,890| 32,503| 32,504|1,234,567,890|1234567891|
| 1138| 7,500| 31,502| 32,505| 7,777| 6808|
| | | | 32,507| 3,000| 42100|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
Note 1: the volume displayed for iceberg orders should be the current peak volume,
not total volume.
Note 2: the order book entries must be displayed in priority order.

The object of this exercise is to implement a simulator for SETSmm Iceberg order functionality in Java as specified in the document SETSmmIcebergSpecification.pdf. Full instructions for this exercise can be found in SETSmmIcebergExercise.pdf.

Notes
You can write and execute code in Codebase, however the platform was designed primarily as a means of distributing and submitting assessments and is not intended to replace a full-featured IDE. You may prefer to develop your solution using a different editor and then upload it via the Files panel on the left-hand side of this page when you are ready to submit your work.
The source code for your solution should be uploaded to the Solution folder and any unit tests should be added to the Test folder.
The file SETSOrderBookExercise.java is the entrypoint to your solution. Do not remove this file as it is required by our test harness.
Clicking Execute will run a set of basic built-in tests as well as any additional tests you write (see ExampleTest.java for an example unit test). You are strongly encouraged to add your own tests based on the behaviour described in the specification as well as any other edge cases you can identify (just like real life!). Any tests you add must be written using JUnit 5.
After you click Submit, your workspace will be locked for editing and we will run a set of more comprehensive tests against your solution. The results of these tests will be shared with the person grading your submission.
We might unlock your workspace again to allow you to make further submissions (e.g. if we spot some small bugs during our initial round of grading) so don’t panic if you click Submit too soon!
Codebase supports OpenJDK 11 (build 11.0.11).
