4.2 Iceberg orders
This section sets out the use and behaviour of iceberg orders on the Exchange’s order
driven trading services. Iceberg orders will be available on SETS and the International
Order Book (IOB) from 22 September 2003. Iceberg orders will be available on
SETSmm from when this service goes live on 3 November 2003.
4.2.1 Background
Market participants with large orders to execute may be reluctant to expose these to
the order book in their entirety because of the potential adverse market impact of
doing so. Investors and brokers consequently adopt alternative trading strategies,
including dealing away from the order book, splitting the order into smaller fragments,
or drip-feeding the order into the order book using automatic entry facilities (often
known as “tranching”).
Introducing iceberg orders will facilitate such trading practices by offering the ability to
execute such business in the central order book, thereby strengthening the market by
concentrating liquidity.
4.2.2 Benefits of iceberg orders
By its nature iceberg orders allow the originator to only display a smaller part
of a larger order in order to limit the market impact costs of that order. The benefits of
iceberg orders over and above the use of existing automated input facilities (referred
to above as ‘tranching’) are as follows:
An iceberg order will increase the originator’s execution capabilities by
maximising volume executed in a single order book execution at the same price
(tranching in an automated input facility will only result in the ‘peak’ size being
executed).
Customers looking to execute aggressively on the order book, eg using an At
Best order, are more likely to achieve better prices when iceberg orders are
available for execution as these will exhaust total iceberg volume before
executing against orders further down the price queue).
To illustrate the above, consider the following example where a participant has
entered an order to sell 100,000 shares at a limit price of 100p into a tranching facility.
The participant has chosen to show the order in tranches of 10,000 shares. The order
in bold in the order book below indicates the first portion of the tranche order.
BUY SELL
Volume Price (p) Price (p) Volume
50,000 25,500 99 98 100 100 103 105 500
10,000
100
20,000

Assume now that an at best order to buy 16,000 shares is entered. During execution,
the incoming order will fully execute the first portion of the tranche order, and some of
the sell orders at worse prices. Only once matching is completed, will the trading
system send out execution confirmation messages to affected participants.
Upon receiving a message informing it that the visible tranche has been fully
executed, the tranching facility will automatically submit another order to sell 10,000
shares at a limit price of 100. The order book will then appear as follows:
BUY SELL
Volume Price (p) Price (p) Volume
50,000 25,500 99 98 100 105 10,000
14,600
Despite being willing to sell at a strictly better (in this case lower) price than the limit
orders at 103p and 105p, the tranching response mechanism has allowed trading to
pass through the limit price of the large order.
Since iceberg orders reside in the Exchange’s system, the hidden volume of an
iceberg order is included in the matching algorithm. This means that unlike the above
scenario, trading cannot pass through a price limit of an iceberg order until all volume
(including hidden volume) at that price limit has been satisfied. Specifically, the
iceberg order has brought the following market efficiencies:
The originator of the iceberg order would have had 15,500 executed as opposed
to just 10,000
The originator of the At Best order has traded all its volume at 100p at a
consideration of £16,000 thanks to the iceberg order. This compares to £16,273
if no iceberg was present, a saving of £273 or 1.7% of total consideration.
4.2.3 How iceberg orders work
An iceberg order is an order that can be partially hidden from market view. Upon entry
of the order, the participant must therefore specify the total order size and the visible
“peak” size. The peak size is the maximum volume that will be shown to the market at
any given instant. To maintain sufficient transparency in the market, a minimum peak
size will be set, defined as a fraction of NMS for that stock.
The trading system will manage the iceberg order by automatically introducing new
full peaks into the matching algorithm and order book following complete execution of
a revealed peak. Each time a new peak enters the order book, it is assigned a new
timestamp and behaves in an identical manner to a conventional limit order.
Acquisition of a new time stamp means that the hidden volume of an iceberg order
loses time priority to other (visible) limit orders at the same price. As described above,
however, the total volume (visible and hidden) of an iceberg order retains continuous
price priority over all other volume at a strictly worse price.
In the examples that follow, the peaks of iceberg orders are identified in bold to aid
understanding. In practice, however, the visible peaks of iceberg orders will not be
distinguishable from conventional limit orders.

4.2.3.1 Aggressive iceberg order entry
When an iceberg enters an order book aggressively, it will participate with its full
volume. Any remaining volume of the order will then be shown to the market in peaks
of a size specified by the participant.
Time BUY Volume Price (p) SELL
Volume Price (p) Time
8:20:25 8:24:09 50,000 25,500 99 98 100 100 101 10,000 7,500 20,000 8:20:32
8:22:57
8:19:00
For example, an iceberg order to buy 100,000 shares at a price of 100p is entered at
8:25:00 into the above order book, and the participant has elected to define the peak
size as 10,000 shares.
The iceberg order will enter the order book aggressively, immediately matching
against the two sell orders at 100p. These trades are effected, and the remaining
iceberg size is 82,500 shares. The first peak of 10,000 shares is then entered into the
order book appearing as a conventional limit order. The order book will appear as
below.
BUY Volume SELL
Volume Time Price (p) Price (p) Time
8:25:00 8:20:25 8:24:09 10,000 50,000 25,500 100 99

4.2.3.2 Passive iceberg order execution
Suppose now that an order to sell 10,000 shares At Best is entered at 8:25:32 in our
previous example.
This incoming order will fully execute the visible peak of the iceberg. Once matching
has occurred, the trading system will automatically refresh the peak in the order book,
assigning it a new time stamp. Total remaining iceberg volume is then 72,500 shares
– 10,000 of which are visible in the order book as below.
BUY Volume SELL
Volume Time Price (p) Price (p) Time
8:25:32 8:20:25 8:24:09 10,000 50,000 25,500 100 99
98
101 20,000 8:19:00
Multiple executions of an iceberg order on the order book will only generate a single
trade message (5TG) for the iceberg participant (ie when an incoming order executes
against the peak of an iceberg order and some or all of the hidden volume).
To show this, consider an order to sell 11,000 At Best which enters the above order
book at 8:26:12. Since trading cannot pass through the price limit of 100p whilst there
24 LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
is still some volume of the iceberg to be satisfied, the incoming order will match
against the revealed peak of the iceberg order, and 1,000 shares of the hidden
volume. The trading system will disseminate these trades in a single message (5TG),
listing the separate trade codes.
The total volume of our iceberg order is now 61,500 shares, and the trading system
must update the order book with the new peak of the iceberg. In the above example,
the new peak will be 9,000 shares (peak size minus the 1,000 shares already
matched of this peak) and the partially executed peak will retain price priority. It will
only be refreshed when a subsequent execution takes the remaining peak size. The
execution will refresh the peak and generate a new time priority. The order book will
therefore appear as below.
BUY Volume SELL
Volume Time Price (p) Price (p) Time
8:26:12 8:20:25 8:24:09 9,000 50,000 25,500 100 99

101 20,000 8:19:00
Suppose that a second iceberg order is entered at 8:28:00 to buy 50,000 shares at a
limit price of 100p, with a revealed peak size of 20,000 shares. To distinguish the
iceberg orders, they have been labeled A and B. The first peak of the new iceberg (B)
will be entered into the order book, which will now appear as below.
BUY SELL
Volume Price (p) Price (p) Volume 8:26:12 9,000A 100 101 20,000 8:19:00

8:20:25 50,000 99
Time Time
When there are multiple icebergs at a single price level, then the new peaks of the
iceberg orders retain time priority amongst themselves. For example, if an order to
sell 35,000 shares At Best is now entered at 8:30, then the visible peaks of both
icebergs will be completely filled, and iceberg A will satisfy the remaining 6,000
shares of the incoming order.
The market will see two trade reports from this series of executions – one for 15,000
shares (against iceberg A), and one for 20,000 shares (against iceberg B). Once
matching has been completed, new peaks of both icebergs are introduced to the
order book, with iceberg A retaining priority over iceberg B.

4.2.3.3 Iceberg order participation in auctions
Iceberg orders participate in auctions, contributing their full volume to the matching
algorithm. The volume visible to the market, however, will continue to be the visible
peak volume. The indicative uncrossing volume message, however, will detail total
25 LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
auction volume including that which is matched against hidden volume of one of more
iceberg orders.
4.2.3.4 Iceberg order modification
Iceberg orders are eligible for order modification by order price, order size, participant
order reference, date and time.
Order Price
If the order price is changed the order will lose time priority.
Order Size
The order size can be changed in several ways:
If the order size is increased, the order will maintain time priority, the peak size
will remain unchanged, and the hidden size will increase
If the order size is decreased, and the resulting remaining total size is greater or
equal to the current remaining peak size, the order will maintain time priority, the
peak size will remain unchanged, and the hidden size will be reduced
If the order size is decreased, and the resulting remaining total size is less than
the current remaining peak size, the order will lose time priority and be refreshed
with a remaining peak size equal to the remaining total size
Please note that it is not possible to modify the peak refresh size of the iceberg order
(note, however, that the remaining peak size will be reduced if the total iceberg size is
modified to a size less than the currently displayed peak).
Participant order reference, date and time
The participant order reference, date and time can only be modified if the price and/or
volume is also changed. As this is a change to the visible order it will lose time
priority.
4.2.3.5 Iceberg order management
The owner of the iceberg order will receive a “hidden” order code. This code refers to
the order as a whole, and can be used to delete the remaining (total) iceberg volume.
If the iceberg order is modified resulting in the displayed size changing, a new hidden
order code will be generated.
Each new peak of the iceberg order will also be assigned a unique “visible” order
code, seen by the market. Since this code is unique and varies with each new peak,
market participants will not be able to tell that the successive peaks are part of the
same iceberg order.
The owner of the order is the only participant knowing both the hidden and visible
order codes, allowing them to retain full “view and do” capability.
